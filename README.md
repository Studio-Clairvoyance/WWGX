The Archived .crx files for Studio Clairvoyance's "Shylily: Womp Womp GX" Opera GX web browser mod.

HOW TO USE:

Once you download your desired .crx, it should automatically add itself to Opera GX. Just simply go into your Extensions page, scroll until you find the version of WWGX you installed, and activate. In case it does not automatically add itself to Opera GX, do the following:

Once the .crx file for your preffered version is downloaded, simply open the "Extensions" tab, typically found on the sdebar in the form of a cube. Once there, simply drag and drop the .crx file onto that page, and then voila, your version of Shylily: Womp Womp GX is installed.
