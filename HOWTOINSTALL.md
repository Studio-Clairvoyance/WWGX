The Archived .crx files for Studio Clairvoyance's "Shylily: Womp Womp GX" Opera GX web browser mod.

HOW TO USE:

Once the .crx file for your preffered version is downloaded, simply open the "Extensions" tab, typically found on the sdebar in the form of a cube. Once there, simply drag and drop the .crx file onto that page, and then voila, your version of Shylily: Womp Womp GX is installed.
